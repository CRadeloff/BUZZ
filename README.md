## FAQ:
1. Does this tool break the EVE Online EULA?

This tool does not use any information besides information that is either publicly available in the SDE, information provided by the ESI Api, and information that a user of this program can extract via in-game mechanics. This program does NOT memory scrape, read pixel values, or anything that would violate the EVE Online EULA. This tool is not intended to violate the EVE Online EULA. That being said, use this software at your discretion.

2. It's asking me to sign in to my accounts, is this safe? Are you stealing my character information?

No, all data related to BUZZ or your characters is stored locally on your PC. The only network traffic BUZZ creates is to/from the ESI api.

3. Can BUZZ run on MAC/Linux?

Not officially. BUZZ is coded in C# using WPF, and wont ever have official support MAC or Linux. However, apparently someone got it to run on their Linux PC, so good luck.

4. BUZZ is super useful! How can I support this?

If you want to support the development of this project, you can always throw some isk to Meigs Abre-Kai in-game.
